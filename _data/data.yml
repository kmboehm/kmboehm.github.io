    title: Bio 
    summary: |
      Kevin Boehm is a resident physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where he is completing the [Transitional Year Internship](https://www.mskcc.org/hcp-education-training/residencies/medicine-transitional-year-internship) followed by the [Radiation Oncology Residency](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/radiation-oncology/residency/residents-fellows).

      Recently, he received his MD and PhD from the [Weill Cornell/Rockefeller/Sloan Kettering Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program](https://mdphd.weill.cornell.edu/), where he completed his dissertation research in [Computational Oncology](https://componcmsk.org/) with [Sohrab Shah](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/sohrab-shah) via the [MSK-MIND](https://componcmsk.org/msk-mind/) Programmatic Initiative.

      His goal is to advance our understanding and management of cancer by using machine learning to harness data generated during clinical care.
