    summary: |
      I am a [postdoc](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/members/kevin-boehm) and [resident](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/radiation-oncology/residency/residents-fellows) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where I am completing the Radiation Oncology Residency and conducting research in Computational Oncology with [Nikolaus Schultz](https://componcmsk.org/personnel/nikolaus-schultz/), [Francisco Sanchez-Vega](https://componcmsk.org/personnel/francisco-sanchez-vega/), and [Sohrab Shah](https://componcmsk.org/personnel/sohrab-shah/). I am also the scientific lead for the Pathology Data Mining team as part of the Cancer Data Science Initiative.

      I received my MD and PhD from the [Weill Cornell/Rockefeller/Sloan Kettering Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program](https://mdphd.weill.cornell.edu/), where I completed my dissertation research in [Computational Oncology](https://componcmsk.org/) with [Sohrab Shah](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/sohrab-shah) via the [MSK-MIND](https://componcmsk.org/msk-mind/) Programmatic Initiative.

      My goal is broadly to advance our understanding and management of cancer by using machine learning to [harness data generated during clinical care](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41568-021-00408-3).  I am especially interested in digital pathology and multimodal machine learning using real-world oncology data to identify biologic state and inform clinical practice.
